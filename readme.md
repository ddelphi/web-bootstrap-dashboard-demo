##Overview

This is a demo, just for trying to use the bootstrap framework to make something.

The concept of writing the structure code is almost the same. Like first coding the layout, then coding the module block, then deal the visual things, and etc.

The most useful things of the framework is the layout module. It can help to layout the page easily, and already handling the compatible problems for you. So you just write the layout code straightly, without worrying those compatible problems.
